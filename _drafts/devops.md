title:  "Leading DevOps in a Small Business"
summary: "Article Summary"
---
After working at [HouseRater][houserater] for a year, I've learned many things about shipping software on a small team,
for a small business, writing software for a small industry of many small companies. My team of four people does
Product Management, DevOps, UX Design and every other detail that makes our product a success. Running this is a lot to
ask of them. Here's what I've learned.

### Section Title

My organization grew from an internal tool to providing services nationwide. And we've learned a lot about how to
support our customers through our internal users. When issues come up, developers can be physically interrupted to
troubleshoot problems in-person, on-the-spot.

### Track Every Conversation

Even at four people, remembering details about our product decisions can be challenging. Every single comment on every
single GitHub Pull Request and Issue realigns discussions to the vision we had for our product a year ago, a week ago,
and far into the future.

> "Can you comment this whiteboard on the ticket?"

^ that phrase should be said after every discussion.
