**I build inspiring products across a range of platforms to help others change
the world through technology.** I'm completely self-taught from a young age, and
have multiple years of professional experience in software development. My first
experiences in computer science began with
[MIT Scratch][scratch]{:target="_blank"} and making iterative changes to
pre-built `CSS` & `HTML` website templates, later evolving into building
advanced custom web applications. I also began building software for iPhone 3G
when the iOS SDK's were newly announced, and have continuously refined my
`Objective-C` and `Swift` skills. More recently, I've been working with
[React Native][react-native]{:target="_blank"} and
[Skech][sketch]{:target="_blank"} to design and build mobile apps.
