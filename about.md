**I build inspiring products across a range of platforms to help others change
the world through technology.** I'm completely self-taught from a young age, and
have multiple years of professional experience in software development. My first
experiences in computer science began with
[MIT Scratch][scratch]{:target="_blank"} and making iterative changes to
pre-built `CSS` & `HTML` website templates, later evolving into building
advanced custom web applications.

Beginning with software development on iPhone when the original SDK's were newly
announced, I continuously refined my `Objective-C` and `Swift` skills. I also
quickly picked up [WordPress][wp]{:target="_blank"} Plugins (PHP) and
[Node.js][node]{:target="_blank"} server-side development to build advanced office
management software in Childcare & energy efficiency. More recently, I've been working
with [React Native][react-native]{:target="_blank"} and [Skech][sketch]{:target="_blank"}
to design and build mobile apps.
