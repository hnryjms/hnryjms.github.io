**I build inspiring products across a range of platforms to help others change
the world through technology.** I'm a [Code42][code42] employee and
Minneapolis resident, and have over 8 years of experience working with software.
I've used with technologies like iOS and OS X, Windows and `C#` servers, Web and
Javascript (including `io.js` and `node`), and many more.

I work with a team of software developers at [Code42][code42] to help build the
most trusted enterprise data security software system leveraging powerful tools
like native cross-platform apps, and a rock-solid server. Much of my personal
work is available as open source projects, like [Expressive][expressive] and
[Builder][builder]. I've also led several skill-based volunteer projects for
local non-profits and small businesses, and built public and in-house apps to
solve big problems.
