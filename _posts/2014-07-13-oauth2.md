This tutorial is an extension of my previous article,
[Using Passport.js and Mongoose for Local User Authentication](http://z43studio.com/2014/04/authentication/).
If you need help getting set up with local user authentication, please follow
that article first.

OAuth2.0 gives your app the ability to work with content producers to share
content between your services and their website. Integrating OAuth2.0 opens a
large range of features you can integrate into your application, including a
safe way to implement authentication inside a mobile application. Rather than
storing usernames and passwords, applications can store safer access codes and
tokens. Before we dive in, lets take a look at how OAuth2.0 works, and how
Passport.js is set up to integrate OAuth2.0.

### How OAuth2.0 Works

The first step in creating an open authentication layer into your app is setting
up a zone for holding the requesting applications metadata. The primary
information you need to hold is the applications _site domain_ for verification
of response redirect URLs, and an active/deactive switch so you can disable
offending applications easily. Other features you can implement on your own
(such as a website for developers to set up their applications on their own,
display title, etc). Next, the requesting application sends users to a specific
URL on your website that asks the user to login, and shows the user what
permissions the application is requesting. The parameters given to your
application here are the ID of the requesting application (`client_id`), the
permissions the application is requesting (`scope`), and the URL to redirect
upon completion or failure of the request (`redirect_uri`). This is where we're
going to validate the apps information against our database, and make sure the
application isn't asking for a scope we don't support. We'll display a login
form with a button for logging in and accepting as one action, or just an
Authorize button if they're already signed in (similar to LinkedIn or Twitter's
OAuth pages, if you are familiar). After our user accepts the connection, we'll
generate and save a grant code into our database, and associate it with that
user, which contains the application and that scope. Grant codes do not have an
expiration date, however, more advanced applications give users the ability to
revoke grant codes (and in doing so, invalidate request tokens as well). We are
going to give the requesting application our grant code when we redirect them to
their redirect URI. The requesting application should save the grant code in
their database, as it will continuously be needed. Finally, the application will
request a temporary request token that expires after approximately fifteen
minutes to an hour by supplying the grant code we gave them, and a secret string
that only that applications servers should hold. The application will continue
to request these tokens as it tries to make a new request if it has no valid
request tokens. The request token is what will be sent with every API
call.

<small>http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E39820_01/doc.11121/gateway_docs/content/images/oauth/oauth_web_server_flow.png</small>

That's it. Now we can move onto integrating this structure into our app.

### Step 1: Database Schemas

To get started, we need a number of database schemas. I'm skipping much of the
verbose details about how Mongoose works, as you probably already know. We are
using the package `uid2` for generating random strings. While adding
`oauth_id` property to our application schema is not necessary (you could use
Mongoose's built-in `Id` property instead), we are using it to give integers
rather than a random string as the application's client ID (which will be used
later). For simplicity's sake, we're not implementing auto-increment feature in
this tutorial—checkout
[mongoose-auto-increment](https://www.npmjs.org/package/mongoose-auto-increment
"mongoose-auto-increment on NPM") for details (note that `field` would be
`oauth_id`).

```js
var uid = require('uid2');

var ApplicationSchema = new Schema({
	title: { type: String, required: true },
	oauth_id: { type: Number, unique: true },
	oauth_secret: { type: String, unique: true, default: function() {
			return uid(42);
		}
	},
	domains: [ { type: String } ]
});
var GrantCodeSchema = new Schema({
	code: { type: String, unique: true, default: function() {
			return uid(24);
		}
	},
	user: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' },
	application: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Application' },
	scope: [ { type: String } ],
	active: { type: Boolean, default: true }
});
var AccessTokenSchema = new Schema({
	token: { type: String, unique: true, default: function() {
			return uid(124);
		}
	},
	user: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' },
	application: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Application' },
	grant: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'GrantCode' },
	scope: [ { type: String }],
	expires: { type: Date, default: function(){
		var today = new Date();
		var length = 60; // Length (in minutes) of our access token
		return new Date(today.getTime() + length*60000);
	} },
	active: { type: Boolean, get: function(value) {
		if (expires < new Date() || !value) {
			return false;
		} else {
			return value;
		}
	}, default: true }
});

var Application = mongoose.model('Application', ApplicationSchema);
var GrantCode = mongoose.model('GrantCode', GrantCodeSchema);
var AccessToken = mongoose.model('AccessToken', AccessTokenSchema);
```

### Step 2: Implementing oauth2orize

The creator of Passport.js also manages plugins for handling OAuth2.0
authentication, named [oauth2orize](https://www.npmjs.org/package/oauth2orize
"oauth2orize on NPM"). This plugin helps implement OAuth2.0 easily into your
application, however I have come to the conclusion that the documentation for
`oauth2orize` is somewhat complex or incomplete. The `oauth2orize` plugin is set
up to create a server, which is then configured for creating grant codes,
creating request tokens, and serializing/deserializing the application into a
browser session (for persisting information between multiple stages of user
login and user acceptance to the requesting application). When the application
requests a new request token from a grant code, we have to find the application
model ourselves and inject it into the `req` variable as `req.app`
(`oauth2orize` confusingly calls requesting applications as 'users', and
Passport.js is already using `req.user` for the actual user). We will take care
of that when we get to exchanging codes, but that is the reason for `{
userProperty: 'app' }` below.

```js
var oauth2orize = require('oauth2orize');

var server = oauth2orize.createServer();

server.grant(oauth2orize.grant.code({
	scopeSeparator: [ ' ', ',' ]
}, function(application, redirectURI, user, ares, done) {
	var grant = new GrantCode({
		application: application,
		user: user,
		scope: ares.scope
	});
	grant.save(function(error) {
		done(error, error ? null : grant.code);
	});
}));
server.exchange(oauth2orize.exchange.code({
	userProperty: 'app'
}, function(application, code, redirectURI, done) {
	GrantCode.findOne({ code: code }, function(error, grant) {
		if (grant && grant.active && grant.application == application.id) {
			var token = new AccessToken({
				application: grant.application,
				user: grant.user,
				grant: grant,
				scope: grant.scope
			});
			token.save(function(error) {
				done(error, error ? null : token.token, null, error ? null : { token_type: 'standard' });
			});
		} else {
			done(error, false);	
		}
	});
}));
server.serializeClient(function(application, done) {
	done(null, application.id);
});
server.deserializeClient(function(id, done) {
	Application.findById(id, function(error, application) {
		done(error, error ? null : application);
	});
});
```

### Step 3: Writing our Authentication API

Now that our oauth2orize server is set up, and we've already implemented
Passport.js user authentication into our app, setting up the pages for our users
to accept or deny requesting applications is going to be much easier. We're
going to use `/auth/start` to start requests—this will be where requesting
applications send users, and `/auth/finish` will be where we check through the
request, generate grant codes, and send them back to the requesting application.
For this example, I'm going to be using the [Jade templating
language](http://jade-lang.com "Jade - Template Engine"). If you passed off Jade
as an ugly language before giving it a chance (like me), I highly recommend
giving it another chance, because it is the most amazing template engine I have
ever used, and plus, it is easy to integrate with Express. We also have to
listen for a URL parameter `response_type`, which tells our application what
type of code the application is looking for (this tutorial only has instructions
for `code` style grants). That parameter will need to follow the flow into the
`/auth/finish` request. Note that I also am allowing the `domains` property in
an Application include custom URL schemes (protocols), letting Applications
redirect to their URL scheme and thus pop back into the application on a mobile
device to complete the authentication (as long as that URL scheme is not http or
https).

```js
var url = require('url');

app.get('/auth/start', server.authorize(function(applicationID, redirectURI, done) {
	Application.findOne({ oauth_id: applicationID }, function(error, application) {
		if (application) {
			var match = false, uri = url.parse(redirectURI || '');
			for (var i = 0; i < application.domains.length; i++) {
				if (uri.host == application.domains[i] || (uri.protocol == application.domains[i] && uri.protocol != 'http' && uri.protocol != 'https')) {
					match = true;
					break;
				}
			}
			if (match && redirectURI && redirectURI.length > 0) {
				done(null, application, redirectURI);
			} else {
				done(new Error("You must supply a redirect_uri that is a domain or url scheme owned by your app."), false);
			}
		} else if (!error) {
			done(new Error("There is no app with the client_id you supplied."), false);
		} else {
			done(error);
		}
   	});
}), function(req, res) {
	
	var scopeMap = {
		// ... display strings for all scope variables ...
		view_account: 'view your account',
		edit_account: 'view and edit your account',
	};
	
	res.render('oauth', {
		transaction_id: req.oauth2.transactionID,
		currentURL: req.originalUrl,
		response_type: req.query.response_type,
		errors: req.flash('error'),
		scope: req.oauth2.req.scope,
		application: req.oauth2.client,
		user: req.user,
		map: scopeMap
	});
});
app.post('/auth/finish', function(req, res, next) {
	if (req.user) {
		next();
	} else {
		passport.authenticate('local', {
			session: false
		}, function(error, user, info) {
			if (user) {
				next();
			} else if (!error) {
				req.flash('error', 'Your email or password was incorrect. Try again.');
				res.redirect(req.body['auth_url'])
			}
		})(req, res, next);
	}
}, server.decision(function(req, done) {
	done(null, { scope: req.oauth2.req.scope });
}));
```

When someone requests `/auth/start`, we render
a page named `oauth`. This page displays what permissions are being requested
from the originating application, a login form if the user is not currently
logged in with an Authorize button combining the two actions, or a simple
Authorize button if they are already signed in. Here's what the page looks like
in Jade.

```jade
.oauth-form
	h1.text-center!= 'Connect with ' + application.title			
	form(method='post', action='/auth/finish')
		input(type='hidden', name='transaction_id', value=transaction_id)
		input(type='hidden', name='response_type', value=response_type)
		input(type='hidden', name='client_id', value=application.oauth_id)
		input(type='hidden', name='auth_url', value=currentURL)
		input(type='hidden', name='scope', value=scope.join(','))

		.well
			p= application.title + ' requires permission to '
				each item in scope
					if scope.indexOf(item) == scope.length-2
						!= '<strong>' + map[item] + '</strong> and '
					else
						if scope.indexOf(item) == scope.length-1
							!= '<strong>' + map[item] + '</strong>'
						else
							!= '<strong>' + map[item] + '</strong>, '
				| .
			if user
				p Click <em>Authorize</em> to allow this app to connect with your account.
			else
				p Sign in below to allow this app to connect with your account.

		each message in errors
			.alert.alert-warning
				p= message

		if user
			.form-group.info-padded
				p.text-center!= 'Signed in as <strong>' + user.name + '</strong>'
			p.text-right
				a(href='/logout?next=' + encodeURIComponent(currentURL))= 'Not ' + user.name + '?'
				button.btn.btn-default(type='submit') Authorize →
		else
			.form-group
				label(for='email') Email address
				input.form-control#email(type='email', name='email', autofocus)
			.form-group
				label(for='password') Password
				p.small!= 'Your password will <strong>not</strong> be shared with <strong>' + application.title + '</strong>'
				input.form-control#password(type='password', name='password')
			p.text-right
				button.btn.btn-default(type='submit') Authorize →
```

### Step 4: Exchanging Grant Codes for Access Tokens

Grant codes are not actually the tokens that requesting applications are going
to be using to get protected data. At this point, our server has already sent
the user back to the originating application, and now it's up to that
application to get an access token for requesting data later. The originating
application can request new access tokens countless times in the future as its
access tokens expire or are invalidated in any way. This request is where the
applications secret key is used. The applications secret key should be protected
on the application's server, and never exposed to users. `oauth2orize` expects
us to implement an entirely new authentication method for applications into
Passport.js, but personally, I believe that the Passport.js authentication
methods should be reserved for authenticating users, rather than mixing them
with methods for authenticating applications. The only benefit I see in using
Passport.js for authentication is multiple ways for an application to validate
itself. However, in number-of-lines of code and number-of-dependencies, it does
not seem very beneficial. So I am writing middleware to inject the app to the
`req.app` variable myself.

```js
app.post('/auth/exchange', function(req, res, next){
	var appID = req.body['client_id'];
	var appSecret = req.body['client_secret'];

	Application.findOne({ oauth_id: appID, oauth_secret: appSecret }, function(error, application) {
		if (application) {
			req.app = application;
			next();
		} else if (!error) {
			error = new Error("There was no application with the Application ID and Secret you provided.");
			next(error);
		} else {
			next(error);
		}
	});
}, server.token(), server.errorHandler());
```

### Step 4.5: Application Integration

Applications now have complete access to authenticate users. Here is where we
would write a guide for app developers about how to use our new authentication
server. URLs to authentication pages can be constructed like so:

```
https://mycoolwebsite.com/auth/start?client_id=OAUTH_ID&response_type=code&scope
=edit_account,do_things&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI
```

When we redirect back to the applications redirect URI, we will include a
`code=GRANT_CODE` URL parameter, or information about why the authorization
attempt failed.

### Step 5: Creating Authenticated API Endpoints

Now that our application can get a grant code and request token, we need to give
that application access to some awesome protected API endpoints for actually
doing cool stuff with our users and our data. While most of the actual APIs are
going to be unique to you and your application, here is how we will be verifying
that an applications access tokens look okay.

```js
var PassportOAuthBearer = require('passport-http-bearer');

var accessTokenStrategy = new PassportOAuthBearer(function(token, done) {
	AccessToken.findOne({ token: token }).populate('user,grant').exec(function(error, token) {
		if (token && token.active && token.grant.active && token.user) {
			done(null, token.user, { scope: token.scope });
		} else if (!error) {
			done(null, false);
		} else {
			done(error);
		}
	});
});

passport.use(accessTokenStrategy);

app.get('/api/me',
	passport.authenticate('bearer', { session: false }),
	function(req, res, next) {
		// ... Here we can do all sorts of cool things ...
		
		res.json(req.user);
	}
);
```

### That's It!

Whoa. That was a lot of information to consume. But hey! You have a working
application implementing user authentication, OAuth2.0 application authorization
and protected API endpoints. How cool is that? If you have any questions about
